# Advanced Programming: Algorithms Analysis (HW1)

This repository contains the solution for Home Assignment 1 in the Advanced Programming course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

The assignment focuses on implementing and analyzing foundational algorithms and data structures in Python.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementation and comparison of Bubble Sort (Standard and Optimized) and a custom Reverse Selection Sort.
* **Search and Efficiency:** Utilizing **Binary Search** principles (Divide and Conquer) for efficient first-occurrence searching (e.g., finding the 'fire floor').
* **Data Structures:** Custom function implementation and manipulation of complex data structures (Lists of Dictionaries) for record management and sorting.
* **Custom Logic:** Development of functions to define and identify "Unique Numbers" based on digit properties.

## Repository Content

* **`advanced_programming_hw1.ipynb`**: Full Python solution notebook with code and execution results.
* **`docs/`**: Original assignment instructions (`assignment_instructions_1.pdf`).
